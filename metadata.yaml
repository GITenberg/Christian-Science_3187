description: Though Mark Twain is best remembered as perhaps the quintessential American
  humor writer, he was also a keen observer and critic of cultural and social trends.
  In this vein, he undertook a book-length discussion and analysis of Christian Science
  and New Thought, both of which enjoyed immense popularity in the nineteenth and
  early twentieth centuries in the United States. The controversial text was originally
  rejected by Twain's publisher, a gesture that the author saw as confirming the influence
  and power of the religious movement.
